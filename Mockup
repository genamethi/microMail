Expected behavior:

!inbox -- Lists names of senders along with counts.
!sent -- Lists names of recipients along with counts.

!dmail [box] <Index> -- Permanently deletes message specified. Uses current view.	

!rmail [box] <Username> <Index> -- Displays specified message.

!cmail <Recipient> <Subject> -- Starts a message. Type message in PM window to mail bot then hit enter to send. Type cancel to cancel composition. (STATEFUL)

!cancel [<Index*>] - Cancels cmail state if active. If Index is specified and the message hasn't been read it will remove the message from the recipients inbox. *Index is the same listed by !sent

tIndex = {

	Inboxes = {
	},
	Outboxes = {
	},
}
