Expected behavior:

!inbox -- Lists names of senders along with counts.
!outbox -- Lists names of recepients along with counts.

!chvw <username> [outbox] -- Defaults to inbox unless outbox is specified. Lists Index, Nick, Subject, Time (and maybe strlen) Use refresh to set you to root. (STATEFUL)

!dmail <Index> -- Permanently deletes message specified. Uses current view.	

!rmail <Index> -- Displays specified message from current view.

!cmail <Recepient> <Subject> -- Starts a message. Use wmail to send. Use refresh to cancel composition. (STATEFUL)

!wmail <Message> -- Sends message to current recepient.

!refresh - Clears all stateful information, then displays inbox.
