Expected behavior:

Commands in < > are required. [ ] are optional (or not needed in all cases)

!inbox -- Lists names of senders along with counts.
!sent -- Lists names of recipients along with counts.

!dmail [box] <Index> -- Permanently deletes message specified. Uses current view. (defaults to inbox)	

!rmail [box] <Index> -- Displays specified message. (defaults to inbox)

!cmail <Recipient> <Subject> -- Starts a message. Type message in PM window to mail bot then hit enter to send. Type cancel to cancel composition. (STATEFUL)

!cancel [Recipient] -- Cancels cmail state if active. Cancels last UNREAD message sent to recipient, otherwise. (requires option if not in composition mode)

!wmail <Username> <Message> -- Same as cmail, not stateful -- sends right away -- However, can't add a subject.

!mhelp -- Lists commands.
